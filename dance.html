        <p><h5>Classical dance
            Main article: Indian classical dance
            Classical dance of India has developed a type of dance-drama that is a form of a total theater. The dancer acts out a story almost exclusively through gestures. Most of the classical dances of India enact stories from Hindu mythology.[36] Each form represents the culture and ethos of a particular region or a group of people.[37]
            
            The criteria for being considered as classical is the style's adherence to the guidelines laid down in Natyashastra, which explains the Indian art of acting. The Sangeet Natak Akademi currently confers classical status on eight Indian classical dance styles: Bharatanatyam (Tamil Nadu), Kathak (North, West and Central India), Kathakali (Kerala), Kuchipudi (Andhra), Odissi (Odisha), Manipuri (Manipur), Mohiniyattam (Kerala), and Sattriya (Assam).[38][39] All classical dances of India have roots in Hindu arts and religious practices.[6][8]
            
            The tradition of dance has been codified in the Natyashastra and a performance is considered accomplished if it manages to evoke a rasa (emotion) among the audience by invoking a particular bhava(gesture or facial expression). Classical dance is distinguished from folk dance because it has been regulated by the rules of the Natyashastra and all classical dances are performed only in accordance with them.[40]
            
            Bharatanatyam
            Main article: Bharatanatyam
            
            Bharatanatyam
            Dating back to 1000 BC, barathanatyam is a classical dance from the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu, practiced predominantly in modern times by women. The dance is usually accompanied by classical Carnatic music.[41] Bharatnatyam is a major genre of Indian classical dance that originated in the Hindu temples of Tamil Nadu and neighboring regions.[42][43][44] Traditionally, Bharatanatyam has been a solo dance that was performed exclusively by women,[45][46] and expressed Hindu religious themes and spiritual ideas, particularly of Shaivism, but also of Vaishnavism and Shaktism.[42][47][48]
            
            Bharatanatyam and other classical dances in India were ridiculed and suppressed during the colonial British Raj era.[49][50][51] In the post-colonial period, it has grown to become the most popular classical Indian dance style in India and abroad, and is considered to be synonymous with Indian dance by many foreigners unaware of the diversity of dances and performance arts in Indian culture.[52]
            
            Kathakali
            Main article: Kathakali
            
            Kathakali
            Kathakali (katha, "story"; kali, "performance") is a highly stylized classical dance-drama form, which originated from Kerala in the 17th century.[53][54][55] This classical dance form is another "story play" genre of art, but one distinguished by its elaborately colorful make-up, costumes and face masks wearing actor-dancers, who have traditionally been all males.[54][55]
            
            Kathakali primarily developed as a Hindu performance art, performing plays and mythical legends related to Hinduism.[56] While its origin are more recent, its roots are in temple and folk arts such as Kutiyattam and religious drama traceable to at least the 1st millennium CE.[54][57] A Kathakali performance incorporates movements from the ancient martial arts and athletic traditions of south India.[54][55][56] While linked to the temple dancing traditions such as Krishnanattam, Kutiyattam and others, Kathakali is different from these because unlike the older arts where the dancer-actor also had to be the vocal artist, Kathakali separated these roles allowing the dancer-actor to excel in and focus on choreography while the vocal artists focused on delivering their lines.[58]
            
            
            kathak dance
            Kathak
            Main article: Kathak
            Kathak is traditionally attributed to the traveling bards of ancient northern India, known as Kathakas or storytellers.[59] The term Kathak is derived from the Vedic Sanskrit word Katha meaning "story", and kathaka in Sanskrit means "he who tells a story", or "to do with stories".[59][60] Kathak evolved during the Bhakti movement, particularly by incorporating childhood and amorous stories of Hindu god Krishna, as well as independently in the courts of north Indian kingdoms.[59][61] It transitioned, adapted and integrated the tastes and Persian arts influence in the Mughal courts of the 16th and 17th century, was ridiculed and declined in the colonial British era,[51][62] then was reborn as India gained independence.[50][63]
            
            Kathak is found in three distinct forms, named after the cities where the Kathak dance tradition evolved – Jaipur, Benares and Lucknow.[64] Stylistically, the Kathak dance form emphasizes rhythmic foot movements, adorned with small bells (Ghungroo), the movement harmonized to the music, the legs and torso are generally straight, and the story is told through a developed vocabulary based on the gestures of arms and upper body movement, facial expressions, stage movements, bends and turns.[50][61][65]
            
            Kuchipudi
            Main article: Kuchipudi
            
            Kuchipudi
            Kuchipudi classical dance originated in a village of Krishna district in modern era Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.[66][67][68] It has roots in antiquity and developed as a religious art linked to traveling bards, temples and spiritual beliefs, like all major classical dances of India.[69][70][71] In its history, the Kuchipudi dancers were all males, typically Brahmins, who would play the roles of men and women in the story after dressing appropriately.[72]
            
            Modern Kuchipudi tradition believes that Tirtha Narayana Yati and his disciple an orphan named Siddhendra Yogi founded and systematized the art in the 17th century.[73][74][75] Kuchipudi largely developed as a Hindu god Krishna-oriented Vaishnavism tradition,[76] and it is most closely related to Bhagavata Mela performance art found in Tamil Nadu, [70] which itself has originated from Andhra Pradesh. The Kuchipudi performance includes pure dance (nritta),[77] and expressive part of the performance (nritya), where rhythmic gestures as a sign language mime the play.[77][78] Vocalists and musicians accompany the artist, and the tala and raga set to (Carnatic music).[79] In modern productions, Kuchipudi dancers include men and women.[80]
            
            Odissi
            Main article: Odissi
            
            Odissi
            Odissi originated in the Hindu temples of Odisha – an eastern coastal state of India.[81][82] Odissi, in its history, was performed predominantly by women,[45][81] and expressed religious stories and spiritual ideas, particularly of Vaishnavism (Vishnu as Jagannath), but also of other traditions such as those related to Hindu gods Shiva and Surya, as well as Hindu goddesses (Shaktism).[83] Odissi is traditionally a dance-drama genre of performance art, where the artist(s) and musicians play out a mythical story, a spiritual message or devotional poem from the Hindu texts, using symbolic costumes,[84] body movement, abhinaya (expressions) and mudras (gestures and sign language) set out in ancient Sanskrit literature.[85]
            
            Sattriya
            Main article: Sattriya
            
            Sattriya
            Sattriya is a classical dance-drama performance art with origins in the Krishna-centered Vaishnavism monasteries of Assam, and attributed to the 15th century Bhakti movement scholar and saint named Srimanta Sankardev.[86][87][88] One-act plays of Sattriya are called Ankiya Nat, which combine the aesthetic and the religious through a ballad, dance and drama.[89][90] The plays are usually performed in the dance community halls (namghar[90]) of monastery temples (sattras).[91] The themes played relate to Krishna and Radha, sometimes other Vishnu avatars such as Rama and Sita.[92]
            
            Manipuri
            Main article: Manipuri Raas Leela
            
            Manipuri Raas Leela dance
            Manipuri Raas Leela dance is a unique form of dance drama which has its origin in Manipur, a state in northeastern India bordering with Myanmar (Burma).[93][94] It is particularly known for its Hindu Vaishnavism themes, and performances of love-inspired dance drama of Radha-Krishna called Ras Lila.[93][95][96] However, the dance is also performed to themes related to Shaivism, Shaktism.[97][98] The Manipuri Raas Leela dance is a team performance, with its own unique costumes notably the Kumil (a barrel shaped, elegantly decorated skirt), aesthetics, conventions and repertoire.[99] The Manipuri dance drama is, for most part, marked by a performance that is graceful, fluid, sinuous with greater emphasis on hand and upper body gestures.[100][101]
            
            Mohiniyattam
            Main article: Mohiniyattam
            
            Mohiniyattam.
            Mohiniyattam developed in the state of Kerala, gets its name from Mohini – the seductress avatar of Vishnu, who in Hindu mythology uses her charms to help the good prevail in a battle between good and evil.[102][103] Mohiniyattam follows the Lasya style described in Natya Shastra, that is a dance which is delicate, with soft movements and feminine.[103][104] It is traditionally a solo dance performed by women after extensive training. The repertoire of Mohiniyattam includes pure and expressive dance-drama performance, timed to sopana (slower melody) styled music,[105][106] with recitation. The songs are typically in Malayalam-Sanskrit hybrid called Manipravala.[103]margin-top: 50px;</p>
